        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.</p>
        <p id="define">The 14th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources. It focuses on addressing ocean acidification, overfishing, marine pollution, and protecting marine biodiversity to ensure sustainable livelihoods and economies for coastal communities worldwide, promoting global environmental sustainability.</p>

        <div class="cards">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Target 14.1</h3>
                <p>By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Target 14.2</h3>
                <p>By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Target 14.3</h3>
                <p>Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Target 14.4</h3>
                <p>By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Target 14.5</h3>
                <p>By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Target 14.6</h3>
                <p>By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation.</p>

        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p>Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface, and they are essential to global well-being. They produce over half of the world's oxygen and absorb 50 times more carbon dioxide than our atmosphere. Oceans also regulate our climate, provide us with food, and are a source of economic livelihood for billions of people.</p>
        <p>However, human activities are placing tremendous pressures on oceans and marine ecosystems. Overfishing, pollution, and climate change are causing significant damage. It is crucial to take immediate action to protect and preserve our oceans for future generations.</p>
        <p>Collaboration between governments, organizations, and individuals is key to achieving these goals. By working together, we can create a sustainable future where both people and the planet can thrive.</p>
